# wordwank

A framework for word games inside a Kubernetes cluster.

In the beginning, we'll start with a universe which has valid words in its universal language.

Toward the end, we will have recreated @tilemasters from LambdaMOO.

Hello. My name is Quinn, and I'm a wordwanker. I'm doing this as exercise in design. Most of the code will be bootstrapped and boilerplated by ChatGPT or whatever other LLM I happen to have handy, unless there's something interesting in the language with which I want to work.

## Installation

Don't be scared! `snap install minikube` then `minikube addons enable ingress` then `minikube start --driver=docker` and then follow the Makefile.
