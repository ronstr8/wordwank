Letter values are based on their frequency in the wank sock: common letters are worth 1 point, while rarer letters earn progressively more (up to 9 points). The two rarest 'Unicorn' letters are worth 10 points! One letter each day is worth 7 points. Scoring is dynamic: find a Unique Word (+5) or aim for Length Bonuses (+5 for 6 letters, doubling for every letter after). Careful: duplicating a word gives you 0 points, but awards a bonus to the original player!",
