# Thanks

This project wouldn't be possible without the excellent work of others. We're grateful to:

## Dictionaries and Lexicons

Wordwank's lexicons are primarily generated from [Hunspell](https://hunspell.github.io/) dictionaries. We are deeply grateful to the Hunspell project and the many contributors who maintain high-quality word lists for every language on Earth.

### Original Lexicon Sources

Before moving to the Hunspell-based generation system, we utilized or derived from the following excellent resources:

- **Spanish**: Derived from [Lemarios del español](http://olea.org/proyectos/lemarios/) by Ismael Olea, via the [javierarce/palabras](https://github.com/javierarce/palabras) repository.
- **English/French/German/Russian**: Various open-source word lists that served as the foundation of the early prototypes.

We normalized these lists (removing accents, filtering lengths, etc.) to create the initial high-speed validation files.
