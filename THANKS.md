# Thanks

This project wouldn't be possible without the excellent work of others. We're grateful to:

## Spanish Word List

Our Spanish word dictionary (`srv/wordd/share/words/es/lexicon.txt`) is derived from:

- **Source**: [Lemarios del español](http://olea.org/proyectos/lemarios/) by Ismael Olea
- **Via**: [javierarce/palabras](https://github.com/javierarce/palabras) GitHub repository
- **License**: Public Domain / Freely distributable
- **Modifications**: We normalized the list by removing accents (á→a, é→e, etc.) while preserving ñ, and filtered to include only lowercase words without punctuation, resulting in an original source count of 79,489 words.
